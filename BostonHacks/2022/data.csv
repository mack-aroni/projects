In this exhibition, artist Bhen Alan crafts intricate tapestries using an ancient Filipino weaving tradition. These tapestries take on sculptural forms with Alan’s use of mixed media such as coconut and bamboo leaves, recycled plastics, woven rice sacks, fans and feathers. This traditional weaving brings a spotlight to Alan’s oft overlooked Filipino heritage in this country. While trying to connect with his own community, Alan uses his art to celebrate his own culture while raising questions of equality and human rights.","11:00 am  – 5:00 pm  on every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, &amp; Saturday until Saturday, December 3, 2022",

A graffiti and design legend, Adams honed his art skills painting the streets and trains of NYC in the late 1970's before moving downtown where the street art was leaking into the city's high end galleries. Like his pop art contemporaries of the time, Adams understood the power of images, media and advertising, a position that left him uniquely suited to give visual life to a new movement called hip hop.
 
CEY ADAMS, DEPARTURE: 40 Years of Art and Design examines Adams' more than 4 decades of work which spans everything from graffiti to designing album covers, t-shirts and posters for some of hip hop's foundational acts, and his expanding commercial collaborations with global brands. With a return to his roots more than a decade ago, Adams has explored his evolving art through fine art and mixed media collages that evoke nostalgia while looking deeper into an Americana that is effortlessly authentic.","11:00 am  – 5:00 pm  on every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, &amp; Saturday until Sunday, December 11, 2022",

Tai chi is typically practiced today as a system of fluid, low-impact movements
for the benefit of health and wellness. Tai chi can be viewed as a form of active
meditation whereby the mind/body connection is developed and used to
coordinate movements through mental awareness. This type of practice has
been associated with a variety of benefits, including relief of stress, better
balance, and improvement in concentration, coordination, and circulation. In
this class, we will focus on the Wu style of tai chi, characterized by smaller,
more compact movements than other styles. (Contact: Sifu Mynor Diaz,

A graffiti and design legend, Adams honed his art skills painting the streets and trains of NYC in the late 1970's before moving downtown where the street art was leaking into the city's high end galleries. Like his pop art contemporaries of the time, Adams understood the power of images, media and advertising, a position that left him uniquely suited to give visual life to a new movement called hip hop.
 
CEY ADAMS, DEPARTURE: 40 Years of Art and Design examines Adams' more than 4 decades of work which spans everything from graffiti to designing album covers, t-shirts and posters for some of hip hop's foundational acts, and his expanding commercial collaborations with global brands. With a return to his roots more than a decade ago, Adams has explored his evolving art through fine art and mixed media collages that evoke nostalgia while looking deeper into an Americana that is effortlessly authentic.","11:00 am  – 5:00 pm  on every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, &amp; Saturday until Sunday, December 11, 2022",

In this exhibition, artist Bhen Alan crafts intricate tapestries using an ancient Filipino weaving tradition. These tapestries take on sculptural forms with Alan’s use of mixed media such as coconut and bamboo leaves, recycled plastics, woven rice sacks, fans and feathers. This traditional weaving brings a spotlight to Alan’s oft overlooked Filipino heritage in this country. While trying to connect with his own community, Alan uses his art to celebrate his own culture while raising questions of equality and human rights.","11:00 am  – 5:00 pm  on every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, &amp; Saturday until Saturday, December 3, 2022",

In this exhibition, artist Bhen Alan crafts intricate tapestries using an ancient Filipino weaving tradition. These tapestries take on sculptural forms with Alan’s use of mixed media such as coconut and bamboo leaves, recycled plastics, woven rice sacks, fans and feathers. This traditional weaving brings a spotlight to Alan’s oft overlooked Filipino heritage in this country. While trying to connect with his own community, Alan uses his art to celebrate his own culture while raising questions of equality and human rights.","11:00 am  – 5:00 pm  on every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, &amp; Saturday until Saturday, December 3, 2022",

A graffiti and design legend, Adams honed his art skills painting the streets and trains of NYC in the late 1970's before moving downtown where the street art was leaking into the city's high end galleries. Like his pop art contemporaries of the time, Adams understood the power of images, media and advertising, a position that left him uniquely suited to give visual life to a new movement called hip hop.
 
CEY ADAMS, DEPARTURE: 40 Years of Art and Design examines Adams' more than 4 decades of work which spans everything from graffiti to designing album covers, t-shirts and posters for some of hip hop's foundational acts, and his expanding commercial collaborations with global brands. With a return to his roots more than a decade ago, Adams has explored his evolving art through fine art and mixed media collages that evoke nostalgia while looking deeper into an Americana that is effortlessly authentic.","11:00 am  – 5:00 pm  on every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, &amp; Saturday until Sunday, December 11, 2022",

In this talk, we study how this relatively new regularization technique improves variable selection by characterizing the optimal SLOPE trade-off between the false discovery proportion (FDP) and true positive proportion (TPP) or, equivalently, between measures of type I and type II error. Additionally, we show that on any problem instance, SLOPE with a certain regularization sequence outperforms the Lasso, in the sense of having a smaller FDP, larger TPP and smaller L2 estimation risk simultaneously. Our proofs are based on a novel technique that reduces a variational calculus problem to a class of infinite-dimensional convex optimization problems and a very recent result from approximate message passing (AMP) theory. With SLOPE being a particular example, we discuss these results in the context of a general program for systematically deriving exact expressions for the asymptotic risk of estimators that are solutions to a broad class of convex optimization problems via AMP.

The major dynamics between the characters themselves are centered on two obsessive love affairs that lead nowhere and a flirtation that brings disaster. Mixing the tragic and the absurd and dealing with a form that allows for ambiguity and contradiction, Uncle Vanya has been deemed ""the first modernist play.”  (David Lan) ""It is the element of might-have-been in Chekhov's characters that makes their sense of waste so tragic ...I know of no more moving climax in world drama.""
