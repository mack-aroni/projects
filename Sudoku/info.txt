The Sudoku folder was a project to try 2 things, the first
being to create a more efficient solution than recursive 
backtracking and the second being to transfer this from Java
to Pygame.

I got relatively close on the first part, transitioning from
random input backtracking to creating a priority queue to 
more efficiently process the next number to place on the board.
However it wouldn't process playing the number and locking it
correctly and thus it wouldn't give a correct solution.

I abandonded the second part in favor of just converting the 
solver from Java to a Python class that could act in the form
of a script.
