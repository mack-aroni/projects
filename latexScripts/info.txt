latexScripts is a collection of python scripts I wrote to 
help solve and convert the proccess of solving matrices to 
the Latex language which I used in my Linear Algebra class.

The static folder uses an input and output txt to input and
display the results.

The tkinter folder uses tkinter to create a executable that
uses two inbuilt displays to display the results
